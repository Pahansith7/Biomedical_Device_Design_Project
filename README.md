#  Simple Low Cost Insulin Pump

Patients with Type-1 and some patients with Type-2 diabetes require the administration of insulin at certain times
of the day to control their blood glucose levels. Using conventional methods requires self-injection by the use of a pen
and most elderly patients need another person to do it on their behalf. However, elderly people with difficulty injecting
needles by themselves and also younger patients with issues due to being afraid of needles are facing problems with
this.
When addressing this problem, we found out that there are existing electronic insulin pumps which address this
solution in other countries. An insulin pump is a product consisting of a needle attached to the body alongside a
portable electronic device which can be refilled with insulin cartridges, designed to administer insulin periodically.
Existing insulin pumps are highly advanced with real-time monitoring of blood glucose levels. And therefore, a very
high price, ((over 1000 USD for a simple pump) is unaffordable for Sri Lankans. Therefore our target is to build a
simpler insulin pump, which suits the needs and economy of Sri Lankan patients.
